Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline – Spring Boot (Self-Hosted Linux Agent)
1. Overview

This repository implements a two-stage Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying a Spring Boot application using a self-hosted Linux agent.
The pipeline is triggered by changes to the main branch and deploys the application as an executable JAR to Azure App Service (Linux) running Java 17.

The design prioritizes:

Deterministic build environments

Full control over runtime tooling

Artifact-based deployment

Production-grade release flow

2. High-Level Architecture
CI/CD Flow

This pipeline runs on a self-hosted Linux agent,:

The agent machine is provisioned and managed by the team

Tools must be pre-installed

The agent persists between pipeline runs

 Right now, your Deploy stage will run automatically if Build succeeds.

To add an approval gateway, you must configure it in the Environment UI .
